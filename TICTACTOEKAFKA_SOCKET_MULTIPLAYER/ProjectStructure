For a well-organized Tic Tac Toe application with Kafka, it’s helpful to divide the project into packages based on functionality. This approach keeps Kafka-specific code separate from core game logic and other services, making the project modular and easier to extend.

### Recommended Package Structure

Here’s a package structure that organizes Kafka components, game logic, and web controllers:

```
com.example.tictactoe
├── config               # Configuration files for Kafka, application, etc.
│   └── KafkaConfig.java
├── controller           # REST controllers for interacting with the application
│   └── GameController.java
├── events               # Events to represent actions in the game (for Kafka messages)
│   ├── PlayerMove.java
│   ├── GameEvent.java
│   └── GameResult.java
├── kafka                # Kafka producer and consumer services
│   ├── MoveProducer.java
│   └── MoveConsumer.java
├── model                # Core models for game state and logic
│   ├── GameState.java
│   └── Player.java
├── service              # Core services to manage game logic
│   ├── GameService.java
│   └── ValidationService.java
└── util                 # Utility classes, e.g., for validating moves or updating game state
    └── GameUtils.java
```

### Package Breakdown

1. **`config`**:
   - Contains configuration classes like `KafkaConfig` to set up Kafka topics, partitions, and other application-specific configurations.

   ```java
   // KafkaConfig.java
   @Configuration
   public class KafkaConfig {
       // Kafka topic and producer configurations
   }
   ```

2. **`controller`**:
   - Contains classes to handle incoming HTTP requests.
   - `GameController` could expose endpoints for starting a game, making a move, and checking game status.

   ```java
   // GameController.java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api/game")
   public class GameController {
       @Autowired
       private GameService gameService;

       // Endpoint to initiate a new game, make moves, etc.
   }
   ```

3. **`events`**:
   - This package includes classes that define the different types of events in the game, including moves, game states, and results. These are the objects sent and received over Kafka.
   - Examples:
     - `PlayerMove`: Represents a player’s move event.
     - `GameEvent`: A general class that can represent different kinds of events in the game.
     - `GameResult`: Represents the result of the game (e.g., win, draw).

   ```java
   // PlayerMove.java
   public class PlayerMove {
       private String playerId;
       private int row;
       private int col;
       // Getters, setters, and constructors
   }
   ```

4. **`kafka`**:
   - This package contains the `MoveProducer` and `MoveConsumer` classes that interact with Kafka.
   - `MoveProducer` sends player moves to Kafka, while `MoveConsumer` listens to Kafka for incoming moves and applies them to the game state.

   ```java
   // MoveProducer.java
   @Service
   public class MoveProducer {
       // Methods for sending messages to Kafka
   }

   // MoveConsumer.java
   @Service
   public class MoveConsumer {
       // Methods for receiving and handling messages from Kafka
   }
   ```

5. **`model`**:
   - Defines the core data structures for the game logic.
   - `GameState`: Represents the Tic Tac Toe board and includes methods for managing game state.
   - `Player`: Represents a player in the game.

   ```java
   // GameState.java
   public class GameState {
       private char[][] board;
       private String currentPlayer;
       // Game state management methods
   }

   // Player.java
   public class Player {
       private String id;
       private String symbol;
       // Player-related attributes and methods
   }
   ```

6. **`service`**:
   - Contains the main logic of the game, handling tasks like managing the game board, determining wins or draws, and validating moves.
   - `GameService`: Manages the core game logic and interacts with Kafka producer/consumer as needed.
   - `ValidationService`: Validates moves to check if they’re legal before they’re sent to Kafka.

   ```java
   // GameService.java
   @Service
   public class GameService {
       private GameState gameState;

       // Methods for updating the game board, checking wins, etc.
   }

   // ValidationService.java
   @Service
   public class ValidationService {
       // Methods to validate moves
   }
   ```

7. **`util`**:
   - Contains helper classes for utility functions that might be reused across the application.
   - `GameUtils`: Provides utility functions like checking for a winning condition or generating a new game board.

   ```java
   // GameUtils.java
   public class GameUtils {
       // Helper functions for game logic
   }
   ```

### Example: Directory Tree View

This is how the project might look on the file system:

```
src
└── main
    └── java
        └── com
            └── example
                └── tictactoe
                    ├── config
                    │   └── KafkaConfig.java
                    ├── controller
                    │   └── GameController.java
                    ├── events
                    │   ├── PlayerMove.java
                    │   ├── GameEvent.java
                    │   └── GameResult.java
                    ├── kafka
                    │   ├── MoveProducer.java
                    │   └── MoveConsumer.java
                    ├── model
                    │   ├── GameState.java
                    │   └── Player.java
                    ├── service
                    │   ├── GameService.java
                    │   └── ValidationService.java
                    └── util
                        └── GameUtils.java
```

### Explanation of Responsibilities

- **`kafka` package** isolates all Kafka messaging functionality so that game logic can be managed independently.
- **`service` package** centralizes the game logic, keeping `GameService` as the primary manager for gameplay flow.
- **`events` package** makes it easy to add or modify event types without affecting the consumer/producer services.
- **`model` package** keeps the core game data structures (such as the board) and player-related information organized and reusable across the project.

This structure provides separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to maintain, test, and expand in the future.
