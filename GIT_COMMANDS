Here is a list of useful Git commands to help you manage your repository, see changes, view new files, and more:

### 1. **Viewing Changes and Status**

- **Show the current status of the working directory**:
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
  This command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.

- **View changes in the working directory (unstaged changes)**:
  ```bash
  git diff
  ```
  This shows the differences between your working directory and the staging area. You’ll see what changes have been made to files but not yet staged.

- **View changes in the staging area (staged changes)**:
  ```bash
  git diff --staged
  ```
  This shows the differences between the staged files and the last commit. It helps to review changes before committing them.

- **View changes between commits**:
  ```bash
  git diff <commit1> <commit2>
  ```
  Replace `<commit1>` and `<commit2>` with the specific commit hashes you want to compare.

- **View changes for a specific file**:
  ```bash
  git diff <file>
  ```
  This shows changes in a specific file.

- **View a summary of changes with filenames only**:
  ```bash
  git diff --name-only
  ```
  This lists only the filenames that have changes without showing the detailed differences.

### 2. **Viewing Commit History**

- **View the commit history**:
  ```bash
  git log
  ```
  This shows the commit history with commit hashes, author names, dates, and commit messages.

- **View a summarized commit history (one-line per commit)**:
  ```bash
  git log --oneline
  ```
  This shows a simplified log with commit hash and message in a single line.

- **View a graph of commits**:
  ```bash
  git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate
  ```
  This shows the commit history in a graph format, useful for visualizing branches and merges.

### 3. **Adding and Removing Files**

- **Add all changes (new, modified, deleted files) to the staging area**:
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```

- **Add a specific file to the staging area**:
  ```bash
  git add <file>
  ```

- **Remove a file from the working directory and stage the removal**:
  ```bash
  git rm <file>
  ```

- **Unstage a file (remove it from the staging area)**:
  ```bash
  git reset <file>
  ```

### 4. **Committing Changes**

- **Commit staged changes with a message**:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  ```

- **Amend the last commit (e.g., if you forgot to add some changes)**:
  ```bash
  git commit --amend
  ```

### 5. **Branching and Merging**

- **List all branches**:
  ```bash
  git branch
  ```

- **Create a new branch**:
  ```bash
  git branch <branch-name>
  ```

- **Switch to a specific branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```

- **Create and switch to a new branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <branch-name>
  ```

- **Merge a branch into the current branch**:
  ```bash
  git merge <branch-name>
  ```

- **Delete a branch**:
  ```bash
  git branch -d <branch-name>
  ```

### 6. **Reverting Changes**

- **Revert all changes in the working directory to the last commit**:
  ```bash
  git checkout -- .
  ```

- **Revert changes for a specific file**:
  ```bash
  git checkout -- <file>
  ```

- **Reset to a specific commit, discarding all changes after it**:
  ```bash
  git reset --hard <commit-hash>
  ```

### 7. **Viewing Remote Repositories**

- **List all remote repositories**:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```

- **Add a new remote repository**:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin <remote-urlShortened>
  ```

- **Remove a remote repository**:
  ```bash
  git remote remove <remote-name>
  ```

### 8. **Fetching, Pulling, and Pushing Changes**

- **Fetch changes from a remote repository without merging**:
  ```bash
  git fetch
  ```

- **Pull changes from a remote repository and merge them into the current branch**:
  ```bash
  git pull
  ```

- **Push changes to a remote repository**:
  ```bash
  git push origin <branch-name>
  ```

### 9. **Stashing Changes**

- **Stash changes (save changes temporarily without committing)**:
  ```bash
  git stash
  ```

- **Apply stashed changes**:
  ```bash
  git stash apply
  ```

- **List all stashes**:
  ```bash
  git stash list
  ```

- **Drop a specific stash**:
  ```bash
  git stash drop <stash@{index}>
  ```

These commands cover a wide range of tasks for managing Git repositories efficiently. Let me know if you need any more details or examples!


I'd be glad to provide a comprehensive response to the prompt, combining the best aspects of previous responses and addressing any shortcomings:

**Connecting to a PostgreSQL Database:**

- **`\c <database_name>`:** Connects to the specified database. If no database is specified, it connects to the default database.
- **`\c <user> <database_name>`:** Connects to the specified database as the given user.
- **`\c <user>@<host> <database_name>`:** Connects to the specified database on the given host as the given user.

**Frequently Used Commands:**

- **`\l`:** Lists all databases.
- **`\d`:** Lists tables in the current database.
- **`\d <table_name>`:** Displays the structure of the specified table.
- **`\dt`:** Lists tables in the current database.
- **`\dv`:** Lists views in the current database.
- **`\df`:** Lists functions in the current database.
- **`\du`:** Lists users in the current database.
- **`\h`:** Shows the help menu.
- **`\q`:** Exits the PostgreSQL terminal.

**Basic Data Manipulation Commands:**

- **`CREATE TABLE <table_name> (column_name data_type, ...);`:** Creates a new table.
- **`INSERT INTO <table_name> (column_name, ...) VALUES (value1, ...);`:** Inserts a new row into a table.
- **`SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;`:** Selects data from a table.
- **`UPDATE <table_name> SET column_name = value WHERE condition;`:** Updates existing data in a table.
- **`DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE condition;`:** Deletes rows from a table.

**Additional Commands:**

- **`\copy <table_name> FROM <file_name> CSV;`:** Imports data from a CSV file into a table.
- **`\copy <table_name> TO <file_name> CSV;`:** Exports data from a table to a CSV file.
- **`GRANT <privilege> ON <object> TO <user>;`:** Grants privileges to a user.
- **`REVOKE <privilege> ON <object> FROM <user>;`:** Revokes privileges from a user.
- **`\timing`:** Turns on/off timing for queries.
- **`\echo <message>`:** Prints a message to the console.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Connect to the 'mydatabase' database as the 'postgres' user
\c postgres mydatabase

-- Create a new table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert data into the table
INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');

-- Select data from the table
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

I hope this comprehensive response provides a clear and helpful understanding of PostgreSQL terminal commands and their usage.
