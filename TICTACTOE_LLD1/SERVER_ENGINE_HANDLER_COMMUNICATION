’s a refined approach:

1. **GameEngine as the Core Component**:
   - `GameEngine` should manage the game state, including the board, player turns, win conditions, and any other game-specific logic.
   - `GameServer` would initialize `GameEngine`, and use it to retrieve updates and broadcast messages to players.

2. **GameServer as a Communication Layer**:
   - The `GameServer` handles player connections, relays player moves to `GameEngine`, and broadcasts updates from the `GameEngine` back to players.
   - `GameServer` thus focuses on managing player communication and state synchronization, not on the game logic itself.

3. **PlayerHandler**:
   - Each `PlayerHandler` communicates directly with `GameServer` and sends moves to `GameEngine` indirectly through `GameServer`.
   - It ensures that communication for each player remains isolated, simplifying individual player message handling.

### Updated Design Outline

Here’s how the interaction between these components could be set up.

```java
// GameEngine.java
public class GameEngine {
    private Board board;
    private Deque<Player> players;

    public GameEngine(List<Player> players) {
        this.board = new Board();
        this.players = new ArrayDeque<>(players);
    }

    public boolean processMove(Player player, String move) {
        // Place piece on the board and check for win condition
        boolean moveSuccessful = board.placePiece(player.getPiece(), move);
        if (moveSuccessful) {
            return checkWinCondition(player);
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean checkWinCondition(Player player) {
        // Implement logic to check win
    }

    public Board getBoardState() {
        return board;
    }

    public Player getNextPlayer() {
        return players.pollFirst();
    }
}
```

```java
// GameServer.java
public class GameServer {
    private ServerSocket serverSocket;
    private GameEngine gameEngine;

    public GameServer(ServerSocket serverSocket) {
        this.serverSocket = serverSocket;
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Server started. Waiting for players...");
        List<Player> players = waitForPlayers();
        this.gameEngine = new GameEngine(players);
        startGameLoop();
    }

    private List<Player> waitForPlayers() {
        List<Player> players = new ArrayList<>();
        // Code to accept player connections and initialize player objects
        return players;
    }

    private void startGameLoop() {
        while (true) {
            Player currentPlayer = gameEngine.getNextPlayer();
            String move = receiveMoveFromPlayer(currentPlayer);

            boolean isWin = gameEngine.processMove(currentPlayer, move);
            if (isWin) {
                broadcastMessage("Player " + currentPlayer.getName() + " has won the game!");
                endGame();
                break;
            }
            broadcastBoardUpdate();
        }
    }

    private String receiveMoveFromPlayer(Player player) {
        // Code to receive move from PlayerHandler
    }

    private void broadcastBoardUpdate() {
        // Code to send updated board state to all players
    }

    private void endGame() {
        // Handle game ending logic and notify players
    }
}
```

```java
// PlayerHandler.java
@AllArgsConstructor
public class PlayerHandler implements Runnable {
    private GameServer gameServer;
    private Socket clientSocket;
    private Player player;
    private BufferedReader reader;
    private PrintWriter writer;

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            String move;
            while ((move = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                gameServer.processMove(player, move); // Relay move to GameServer
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Connection error with player: " + player.getName());
        }
    }

    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        writer.println(message);
    }
}
```

### Key Points in This Structure:

- **`GameEngine` Manages the Game State**: The `GameEngine` controls the core game logic—validating moves, updating the board, and checking for win conditions.
- **`GameServer` Handles Communication**: `GameServer` gathers moves from players, sends them to `GameEngine`, and then broadcasts updates or win notifications back to all players.
- **`PlayerHandler` Serves Each Player Individually**: Each `PlayerHandler` receives inputs from a player and communicates these inputs to `GameServer`.

### Advantages of This Structure

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: `GameEngine` is isolated from communication logic, focusing solely on the game logic, making it easier to maintain.
2. **Testability**: Each component (`GameEngine`, `GameServer`, and `PlayerHandler`) can be tested independently.
3. **Flexibility**: This design makes it easier to add new features, like supporting a replay mechanism or adding new game modes, as `GameEngine` encapsulates the game state and logic entirely.
