To enable a computer player and add support for commands via sockets or a web API, we can make the following adjustments:

### 1. **Strategy Pattern for Player Moves**
   - Introduce a `PlayerStrategy` interface with implementations for `HumanPlayerStrategy` and `ComputerPlayerStrategy`. This allows you to have different behaviors for player types without changing the core game logic.

### 2. **Command Execution Over Network**
   - Implement a `CommandHandler` that can process commands sent via a socket or web API. This handler will accept serialized commands, validate, and execute them on the server side.

### Refactored Code for These Adjustments:

```java
// Strategy Interface for different player types
public interface PlayerStrategy {
    GridPosition getMove(Board board, InputHandler inputHandler, int boardSize, String prompt);
}

// Implementation for Human players
public class HumanPlayerStrategy implements PlayerStrategy {
    @Override
    public GridPosition getMove(Board board, InputHandler inputHandler, int boardSize, String prompt) {
        return inputHandler.requestGridPosition(prompt, boardSize);
    }
}

// Implementation for Computer players (random move example)
public class ComputerPlayerStrategy implements PlayerStrategy {
    private final Random random = new Random();

    @Override
    public GridPosition getMove(Board board, InputHandler inputHandler, int boardSize, String prompt) {
        GridPosition position;
        do {
            int row = random.nextInt(boardSize);
            int col = random.nextInt(boardSize);
            position = new GridPosition(row, col);
        } while (!board.isValidMove(position));
        return position;
    }
}

// Player class now accepts a strategy for move behavior
@Getter
public class Player {
    private final String name;
    private final Piece piece;
    private final PlayerStrategy strategy;

    public Player(String name, Piece piece, PlayerStrategy strategy) {
        this.name = name;
        this.piece = piece;
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public GridPosition takeTurn(Board board, InputHandler inputHandler, int boardSize, String prompt) {
        return strategy.getMove(board, inputHandler, boardSize, prompt);
    }
}

// TicTacToeGame with Socket and API command handling
@Getter
public class TicTacToeGame {
    private Board board;
    private List<Player> players;
    private InputHandler inputHandler;
    private CommandHandler commandHandler;  // Command handler for sockets/API

    public void initGame(InputHandler inputHandler, CommandHandler commandHandler) {
        this.inputHandler = inputHandler;
        this.commandHandler = commandHandler;
        int size = inputHandler.requestInt("Enter Board Size [3-10]: ", 3, 10);
        this.board = new Board(size);
        initializePlayers();
    }

    private void initializePlayers() {
        players = List.of(
            createPlayer("Enter player 1 name: ", new PieceX(), new HumanPlayerStrategy()),
            createPlayer("Enter player 2 name: ", new PieceO(), new ComputerPlayerStrategy()) // Or HumanPlayerStrategy
        );
    }

    private Player createPlayer(String prompt, Piece piece, PlayerStrategy strategy) {
        String playerName = inputHandler.requestString(prompt);
        return new Player(playerName, piece, strategy);
    }

    public void startGame() {
        Deque<Player> turnQueue = new ArrayDeque<>(players);
        while (true) {
            board.drawBoard();
            Player currentPlayer = turnQueue.removeFirst();
            if (!playTurn(currentPlayer, turnQueue)) {
                continue;
            }
            if (isGameOver(currentPlayer)) {
                break;
            }
            turnQueue.addLast(currentPlayer);
        }
        inputHandler.close();
    }

    private boolean playTurn(Player currentPlayer, Deque<Player> turnQueue) {
        int size = board.getSize();
        String prompt = String.format("%s [%s]'s turn\nEnter row,column to place piece:",
                                       currentPlayer.getName(), currentPlayer.getPiece().getPieceType());
        GridPosition gridPosition = currentPlayer.takeTurn(board, inputHandler, size, prompt);
        Command command = new PlacePieceCommand(board, gridPosition);

        if (!command.isValidCommand()) {
            System.out.println("Invalid move: position is either occupied or out of bounds.");
            turnQueue.addFirst(currentPlayer);
            return false;
        }
        commandHandler.handleCommand(command);  // Execute via CommandHandler
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isGameOver(Player currentPlayer) {
        GridPosition lastMove = currentPlayer.getLastMove();
        if (board.hasMatchingLine(lastMove)) {
            System.out.println(currentPlayer.getName() + " wins!");
            return true;
        }
        if (board.isFull()) {
            System.out.println("The game is a tie.");
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

// CommandHandler class to handle commands from socket or web API
public class CommandHandler {
    public void handleCommand(Command command) {
        if (command.isValidCommand()) {
            command.execute();
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid command received");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **PlayerStrategy**: This allows both human and computer players to make moves through their specific strategies.
2. **CommandHandler**: Abstracts the handling of commands, allowing for centralized command processing via network-based communication.
3. **Socket/Web API Communication**: Commands can now be serialized and passed to `CommandHandler` over sockets or an API endpoint, which will validate and execute them.

With this setup, you can seamlessly add more strategies (e.g., AI-based moves) and integrate commands over network protocols.
