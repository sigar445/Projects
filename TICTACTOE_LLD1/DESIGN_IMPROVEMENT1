It's great that you're starting with **Tic Tac Toe** as a foundational project for improving your **low-level design (LLD)** knowledge. From what you've shared, your project structure already shows good planning, and you seem to be organized in terms of separating concerns (game logic, player model, board handling, etc.). However, there are areas for improvement and potential additions, both in terms of the design itself and in terms of expanding your project portfolio for more advanced topics.

### **Improvements and Additions for Tic Tac Toe Project**

#### 1. **Refactor to Follow SOLID Principles:**
   The design could be made even more modular and extensible by adhering strictly to the SOLID principles:

   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class should have only one reason to change. For example, the `Board` class currently might handle too many responsibilities like tracking the state of the board and possibly validating moves. This can be split into separate classes (like a **BoardManager** for managing state, and a **BoardValidator** for validation logic).
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Make it easy to extend the game logic (e.g., add more pieces or new types of players, such as an AI player).
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Ensure that subclasses like `PieceX` and `PieceO` are used interchangeably without altering the expected behavior of the game.
   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Split larger interfaces into smaller, more specific ones. For example, you could have a `Player` interface with `HumanPlayer` and `AIPlayer` implementing the common actions for each type.
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions. E.g., Instead of directly instantiating the game board or players in `TicTacToeGame.java`, inject them via constructors or factories.

#### 2. **Design Patterns:**
   Some design patterns that could improve the extensibility and readability of your project:
   - **Factory Pattern**: You have `PieceX` and `PieceO`, which are subclasses of `Piece`. A factory could create these pieces based on user input, improving maintainability and reducing tight coupling.
   - **Command Pattern**: You could use the command pattern for handling moves, where each move is encapsulated as a command that can be executed, undone, or repeated.
   - **Observer Pattern**: For larger games, you might need to implement a system where components like the UI or AI are updated when the game state changes. This could be done using the observer pattern.

#### 3. **Testing Improvements:**
   - **Unit Tests**: Your `BoardTests` and `TicTacToeGameTests` are a good start, but ensure comprehensive coverage:
     - Test edge cases, like invalid moves or trying to place a piece on an already filled position.
     - Mock or use test doubles for external dependencies (like user input).
     - Include tests for AI logic if applicable.
   - **Mocking Framework**: Consider using frameworks like **Mockito** for mocking dependencies in your tests, which will help in isolating the tests.
   - **Test Driven Development (TDD)**: If you havenâ€™t already, try to implement the game using **TDD** to improve your design decisions and to ensure that the logic is correct from the start.

#### 4. **Dockerization & Containerization:**
   - **Docker**: You could containerize the game application to make it easier to deploy. This is especially useful if you want to scale the game to multiple users or deploy in a cloud environment.
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for your Java project and ensure it runs inside a container. This will allow you to run it in different environments without worrying about compatibility issues.

     Example Dockerfile for Java:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine
     COPY target/tictactoe.jar /usr/app/tictactoe.jar
     WORKDIR /usr/app
     CMD ["java", "-jar", "tictactoe.jar"]
     ```

#### 5. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** to automate testing and deployment of your project. You can automate:
   - Building the project.
   - Running unit tests.
   - Dockerizing the app (if needed).

### **Next-Level Projects (Increased Complexity)**

As you progress, you can keep building on your project to incorporate more complex technologies and designs. Below are some suggestions for projects that could take anywhere from **1 day to 1 week** to implement, increasing in complexity and introducing new technologies like Kafka, Spark, NoSQL, SQL, Cloud, etc.

#### **Project 1: Real-Time Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe (1-3 days)**

- **Objective**: Add multiplayer functionality where users can play in real-time over a network.
- **Technologies**: WebSockets, Java Sockets, or REST APIs.
- **Concepts**:
  - Add a **Server** and **Client** model.
  - Implement a **WebSocket-based communication** for real-time play.
  - The server will handle game state and player moves.
  - Add player matchmaking and session management.

#### **Project 2: Distributed Tic Tac Toe with Kafka (2-5 days)**

- **Objective**: Implement a distributed version of Tic Tac Toe with Kafka to manage game state across multiple instances.
- **Technologies**: **Apache Kafka**, Docker, Spring Boot, Java.
- **Concepts**:
  - Use Kafka to send and receive events (e.g., player move).
  - Implement a producer-consumer model where each move is a message in Kafka.
  - Use a **Kafka stream** to maintain the current game state across multiple services.
  - This will also introduce you to **Kafka topics**, **partitions**, and **consumers**.

#### **Project 3: Leaderboard System with NoSQL (MongoDB)**

- **Objective**: Track the scores of players in the Tic Tac Toe game and store it in a **NoSQL database** (MongoDB).
- **Technologies**: **MongoDB**, **Spring Data MongoDB**, **Docker**.
- **Concepts**:
  - Create a leaderboard feature where player scores are tracked.
  - Store player stats and game history in MongoDB.
  - Use **Docker Compose** to set up MongoDB in your local environment.
  - Implement pagination or sorting based on scores in MongoDB.

#### **Project 4: Analytics with Spark (3-7 days)**

- **Objective**: Implement a system that analyzes player statistics (e.g., win rates, moves per game) using **Apache Spark**.
- **Technologies**: **Apache Spark**, **Spark Streaming**, **Python/Java**.
- **Concepts**:
  - Store game logs in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
  - Process the game data with Spark to compute metrics like average moves, win rates, etc.
  - Use **Spark Streaming** to process the game data in real-time as players complete games.
  - Integrate with a **SQL** or **NoSQL** database for persistent storage of stats.

#### **Project 5: Cloud Integration (AWS/GCP) (5-7 days)**

- **Objective**: Deploy the Tic Tac Toe game on **AWS** or **GCP** with a cloud-native architecture.
- **Technologies**: **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **S3**, **RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)**.
- **Concepts**:
  - Deploy a simple backend using **AWS Lambda** or **Google Cloud Functions** for serverless architecture.
  - Use **API Gateway** to expose your game logic as REST APIs.
  - Store game data (e.g., scores, player info) in a cloud database like **RDS**.
  - Use **S3** for storing static assets or logs.
  - Ensure proper scaling based on user demand.

#### **Project 6: Kubernetes and Docker Orchestration (5-7 days)**

- **Objective**: Deploy the game as microservices and manage them with **Kubernetes**.
- **Technologies**: **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Helm**, **AWS/GCP**.
- **Concepts**:
  - Dockerize the Tic Tac Toe application and its components (game logic, leaderboard, etc.).
  - Use **Kubernetes** to orchestrate multiple containers for scalability.
  - Set up a **Kubernetes cluster** on AWS (EKS) or GCP (GKE).

### **Additional Tools and Technologies to Explore:**
- **SQL vs NoSQL**: Learn to choose between relational and non-relational databases based on the use case.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Kafka and similar tools are a great way to move toward **event-driven systems**.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Break the game into microservices (for example, a user service, a leaderboard service, a match service, etc.).
- **CI/CD**: Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
- **Distributed Systems**: Learn about CAP theorem, consistency, and how distributed systems work in the context of cloud deployments.

By incrementally expanding the Tic Tac Toe project into more complex areas, you'll develop a deep understanding of **cloud infrastructure**, **distributed systems**, **big data**, and **devops practices**. This will allow you to integrate different technologies while still sticking to the same project structure.
