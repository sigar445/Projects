Here's an improved version of your `Invoker` class, incorporating the latest Java practices, better naming conventions, additional features, and a more robust design. This revised code includes enhanced error handling, immutability where applicable, better encapsulation, and clear method names.

### **Improved Invoker Class Design**

#### **Key Improvements:**
1. **Immutability**: The `history` list is now `private` and final, encapsulating it fully with controlled access.
2. **Optional Return Types**: Use `Optional` for safe access and handling of potential `null` results.
3. **Command Validation**: More descriptive error messages and validation have been added.
4. **Undo Stack**: A stack is used for undo operations, simplifying the undo feature and ensuring commands are undone in reverse order of execution.
5. **Functional Interface Usage**: Improved with lambda expressions where appropriate.
6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Optionally added to track command execution for better traceability.

### **Refactored Code:**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;
import java.util.Stack;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

// Command interface with execute and undo methods
interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}

// Invoker class that manages commands
public class CommandInvoker {
    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(CommandInvoker.class.getName());
    private final List<Command> commandHistory = new ArrayList<>(); // Stores all commands
    private final Stack<Command> undoStack = new Stack<>();        // Tracks commands for undo

    /**
     * Adds a command to the invoker's history and returns the command's index.
     *
     * @param command The command to be added.
     * @return The index of the added command.
     */
    public int addCommand(Command command) {
        commandHistory.add(command);
        LOGGER.info("Command added to history at index: " + (commandHistory.size() - 1));
        return commandHistory.size() - 1;
    }

    /**
     * Executes the command at the given index if valid, otherwise throws an exception.
     *
     * @param index The index of the command to be executed.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the index is out of range.
     */
    public void executeCommand(int index) {
        validateIndex(index).ifPresentOrElse(command -> {
            command.execute();
            undoStack.push(command);  // Push the command to the undo stack after execution
            LOGGER.info("Executed command at index: " + index);
        }, () -> {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid index. Must be between 0 and " + (commandHistory.size() - 1));
        });
    }

    /**
     * Undoes the last executed command from the undo stack.
     */
    public void undoLastCommand() {
        if (!undoStack.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = undoStack.pop();
            command.undo();
            LOGGER.info("Undone last executed command.");
        } else {
            LOGGER.warning("No commands to undo.");
        }
    }

    /**
     * Undoes the command at the given index if valid, otherwise throws an exception.
     *
     * @param index The index of the command to be undone.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the index is out of range.
     */
    public void undoCommand(int index) {
        validateIndex(index).ifPresentOrElse(command -> {
            command.undo();
            LOGGER.info("Undone command at index: " + index);
        }, () -> {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid index. Must be between 0 and " + (commandHistory.size() - 1));
        });
    }

    /**
     * Validates the command index and returns an Optional containing the command if valid.
     *
     * @param index The index to validate.
     * @return An Optional containing the Command if the index is valid.
     */
    private Optional<Command> validateIndex(int index) {
        if (index >= 0 && index < commandHistory.size()) {
            return Optional.of(commandHistory.get(index));
        } else {
            return Optional.empty();
        }
    }
}
```

### **Key Changes Explained:**

1. **Improved Error Handling**: The `validateIndex` method checks the index range and provides a descriptive error message. It uses `Optional` to avoid direct `null` checks.

2. **Undo Mechanism**: The use of an `undoStack` simplifies the undo functionality by keeping track of commands as they are executed, ensuring they are undone in reverse order.

3. **Logging**: The `Logger` provides traceability for command operations, which is essential for debugging and monitoring command executions.

4. **Clean and Consistent Naming**: All method names clearly reflect their actions, making the code self-explanatory.

5. **Avoiding Direct Access**: Methods operate on the `commandHistory` and `undoStack`, preventing any direct manipulation of internal data.
