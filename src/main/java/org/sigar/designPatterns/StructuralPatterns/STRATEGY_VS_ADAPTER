Let's explore how the **Strategy** and **Facade** patterns could be applied to a similar scenario involving payment processing, but with slightly different requirements that align with each pattern's intent. I'll present each pattern with modified scenarios that highlight when they would be more appropriate compared to the Adapter pattern.

### 1. Strategy Pattern Example

**Scenario**: Suppose you are building an e-commerce platform that supports multiple discount strategies (e.g., percentage discount, flat discount, seasonal discount). The discount strategy needs to be dynamically selected and applied based on user input, promotions, or business logic. Here, each strategy represents a different way of calculating the discount, and they need to be interchangeable.

#### Key Components:
- **Context (`ECommercePlatform`)**: Manages the discount strategy and applies it to orders.
- **Strategy Interface (`DiscountStrategy`)**: Defines the method for calculating the discount.
- **Concrete Strategies (`PercentageDiscount`, `FlatDiscount`, `SeasonalDiscount`)**: Implements the `DiscountStrategy` interface with different discount algorithms.

    | DiscountStrategy |<-----------|   ECommercePlatform  |
    +------------------+            +----------------------+
    | + apply(): double|            | - strategy: DiscountStrategy |
    +------------------+            | + setStrategy(): void        |
           ^                        | + calculateFinalPrice():double|
           |                        +----------------------+
           |
  +---------+-----------+
  |                     |
+----------------+  +------------------+
| FlatDiscount   |  | PercentageDiscount|
+----------------+  +------------------+
| + apply():double| | + apply(): double |
+----------------+  +------------------+
```

#### Java Code Implementation

##### Strategy Interface: `DiscountStrategy`
```java
// Strategy interface
public interface DiscountStrategy {
    double apply(double amount);
}
```

##### Concrete Strategies: `FlatDiscount`, `PercentageDiscount`
```java
// Concrete Strategy: Flat discount
public class FlatDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    @Override
    public double apply(double amount) {
        return amount - 20; // Flat discount of $20
    }
}

// Concrete Strategy: Percentage discount
public class PercentageDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    @Override
    public double apply(double amount) {
        return amount * 0.9; // 10% discount
    }
}
```

##### Context: `ECommercePlatform`
```java
// Context class that uses the strategy
public class ECommercePlatform {
    private DiscountStrategy discountStrategy;

    public void setStrategy(DiscountStrategy discountStrategy) {
        this.discountStrategy = discountStrategy;
    }

    public double calculateFinalPrice(double amount) {
        if (discountStrategy == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Discount strategy not set.");
        }
        return discountStrategy.apply(amount);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ECommercePlatform platform = new ECommercePlatform();

        platform.setStrategy(new FlatDiscount());
        System.out.println("Final Price (Flat Discount): $" + platform.calculateFinalPrice(100));

        platform.setStrategy(new PercentageDiscount());
        System.out.println("Final Price (Percentage Discount): $" + platform.calculateFinalPrice(100));
    }
}
```

### Why Use Strategy Here?

- **Intent**: The Strategy pattern is used because we want to encapsulate different algorithms (ways of calculating discounts) and make them interchangeable. The client code (`ECommercePlatform`) can switch strategies dynamically, depending on the requirements.

### 2. Facade Pattern Example

**Scenario**: Suppose you have an e-commerce platform with a complex set of subsystems for handling payments, inventory management, and order fulfillment. You want to simplify the interface for processing an order by creating a single, unified API. Here, the Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to these subsystems without exposing their complexities to the client.

#### Key Components:
- **Facade (`OrderProcessor`)**: Provides a simplified interface for processing orders.
- **Subsystems (`PaymentService`, `InventoryService`, `ShippingService`)**: Handle specific tasks related to processing orders.

#### UML Diagram

```plaintext
    +--------------------+
    |   OrderProcessor   | Facade class
    +--------------------+
    | + processOrder()   |
    +--------------------+
        |          |         |
        |          |         |
+------------+ +-----------+ +--------------+
| Payment    | | Inventory | | Shipping     |
| Service    | | Service   | | Service      |
+------------+ +-----------+ +--------------+
| + pay()    | | + check() | | + ship()     |
+------------+ +-----------+ +--------------+
```

#### Java Code Implementation

##### Subsystems: `PaymentService`, `InventoryService`, `ShippingService`
```java
// Subsystem 1: Payment Service
public class PaymentService {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Payment of $" + amount + " processed.");
    }
}

// Subsystem 2: Inventory Service
public class InventoryService {
    public void checkInventory(String item) {
        System.out.println("Inventory checked for item: " + item);
    }
}

// Subsystem 3: Shipping Service
public class ShippingService {
    public void shipItem(String item) {
        System.out.println("Shipping initiated for item: " + item);
    }
}
```

##### Facade Class: `OrderProcessor`
```java
// Facade class
public class OrderProcessor {
    private PaymentService paymentService;
    private InventoryService inventoryService;
    private ShippingService shippingService;

    public OrderProcessor() {
        this.paymentService = new PaymentService();
        this.inventoryService = new InventoryService();
        this.shippingService = new ShippingService();
    }

    public void processOrder(String item, double amount) {
        inventoryService.checkInventory(item);
        paymentService.pay(amount);
        shippingService.shipItem(item);
    }
}
```

##### Client Code
```java
public class ECommerceFacadeClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OrderProcessor orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor();
        orderProcessor.processOrder("Laptop", 1500.0);
    }
}
```

### Why Use Facade Here?

- **Intent**: The Facade pattern is used because we want to provide a unified and simplified interface to multiple complex subsystems (payment, inventory, shipping). The client interacts with a single `OrderProcessor` class, which handles all the intricacies of the underlying systems, thereby reducing the complexity for the client.

### Summary of Usage Scenarios

- **Adapter Pattern**: Used when you need to bridge the gap between incompatible interfaces without changing existing code.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Used when you need to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable, allowing the client to choose an algorithm at runtime.
- **Facade Pattern**: Used when you need to simplify interactions with complex subsystems by providing a unified and simplified interface.

These tailored examples illustrate the unique aspects of each pattern, demonstrating how they can be applied to similar scenarios while serving different design intents.
