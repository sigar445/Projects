In practical scenarios, devices like a coffee maker, alarm, and thermostat typically do not directly trigger other devices; instead, their states or actions are detected by sensors or event listeners, and the mediator acts upon those changes. To better reflect a realistic setup, we can modify the implementation to incorporate an event-driven approach that mimics real-world use cases.

### **Practical Improvements:**

1. **Event Listeners or Sensors**: Devices will update the mediator about their status changes (e.g., an alarm goes off, or someone leaves home), and the mediator will decide what actions to take based on those events.

2. **Device States and Triggers**: Devices will report changes in their state (like the alarm ringing), and the mediator will respond accordingly by commanding other devices to act.

3. **Decoupling Action from Events**: Devices do not directly call methods on other devices; instead, the mediator handles all actions based on the reported event.

### **Updated Implementation for Practical Use Case**

#### **Components:**
- **Sensors/Triggers**: Simulate events such as leaving the house or an alarm going off.
- **Mediator (`HomeController`)**: Monitors events and coordinates responses.
- **Devices (`Thermostat`, `CoffeeMaker`, `Alarm`, `Tablet`)**: Devices only report state changes to the mediator.

### **Key Adjustments:**

1. **Devices Don't Directly Trigger Others**: Devices only report events (like `Alarm` going off). The mediator decides what actions to take, reflecting how real systems usually operate.

2. **Sensors or External Triggers**: We introduce a `Sensor` class that simulates external events like leaving the house or detecting Saturday morning, making the system more realistic.

3. **Decoupling Logic**: Devices are not aware of each other and only focus on their responsibilities, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

4. **Mediator Manages Coordination**: The mediator controls how devices respond to events, enhancing maintainability by centralizing the decision-making process.

This design effectively captures how smart home systems typically function, where devices operate independently but are coordinated by a central controller based on real-world events or conditions.
