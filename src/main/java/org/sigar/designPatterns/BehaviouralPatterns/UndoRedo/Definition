Designing an **Undo/Redo** functionality for a chess game involves considering the game state, how moves are applied and reverted, and how to efficiently manage the history of moves. This can be thought of in terms of several design patterns, but a common approach is to use the **Command Design Pattern** combined with a stack-based history mechanism.

### Key Concepts and Design Approach

1. **Command Design Pattern**:
   - The **Command Pattern** is useful for encapsulating all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event. In a chess game, each move can be represented as a command that knows how to execute and undo itself.
   - Each move (command) should contain:
     - The piece being moved.
     - The starting and ending positions.
     - Any special rules (like castling, en passant, or pawn promotion).

2. **Encapsulating Moves**:
   - Create a `MoveCommand` class that implements an interface `Command` with methods `execute()` and `undo()`.
   - The `execute()` method applies the move to the board, while the `undo()` method reverses the move, restoring the previous game state.

3. **Stack-Based History for Undo/Redo**:
   - Use two stacks to manage the moves: `undoStack` and `redoStack`.
   - When a move is made (`MoveCommand.execute()`), it is pushed onto the `undoStack`. If a move is undone, it's popped from the `undoStack` and pushed onto the `redoStack`.
   - When a move is redone, it is popped from the `redoStack`, executed again, and pushed back onto the `undoStack`.

4. **Handling Game State**:
   - The board state needs to be updated with every move. This can be achieved by having a `Board` class that represents the game state.
   - Moves alter the state of the `Board`, and undoing a move restores the previous state using information stored in the `MoveCommand`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion require additional logic to be correctly executed and undone.
   - Care must be taken to ensure the `undo()` and `redo()` methods account for all possible states, including captures, check, and checkmate.

### Example Implementation

Here's a high-level approach to implementing the above design:

```java
// Command Interface
interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}

// Concrete Command Class
class MoveCommand implements Command {
    private Piece piece;
    private Position startPosition;
    private Position endPosition;
    private Board board;
    private Piece capturedPiece; // To store any captured piece during the move

    public MoveCommand(Piece piece, Position start, Position end, Board board) {
        this.piece = piece;
        this.startPosition = start;
        this.endPosition = end;
        this.board = board;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        // Execute move logic, store captured piece if any
        capturedPiece = board.movePiece(piece, startPosition, endPosition);
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        // Undo the move, restore captured piece if any
        board.movePiece(piece, endPosition, startPosition);
        if (capturedPiece != null) {
            board.placePiece(capturedPiece, endPosition);
        }
    }
}

// Board Class to represent the game state
class Board {
    // Assume board is an 8x8 grid and we have methods to move and place pieces

    public Piece movePiece(Piece piece, Position from, Position to) {
        // Logic to move the piece and return any captured piece
    }

    public void placePiece(Piece piece, Position position) {
        // Logic to place a piece back on the board
    }
}

// Client code handling the stack-based history
class Game {
    private Stack<Command> undoStack = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<Command> redoStack = new Stack<>();
    private Board board = new Board();

    public void makeMove(Piece piece, Position from, Position to) {
        MoveCommand move = new MoveCommand(piece, from, to, board);
        move.execute();
        undoStack.push(move);
        redoStack.clear(); // Clear redo stack as new moves invalidate redo history
    }

    public void undoMove() {
        if (!undoStack.isEmpty()) {
            Command move = undoStack.pop();
            move.undo();
            redoStack.push(move);
        }
    }

    public void redoMove() {
        if (!redoStack.isEmpty()) {
            Command move = redoStack.pop();
            move.execute();
            undoStack.push(move);
        }
    }
}
```

### Advantages of This Approach

- **Encapsulation**: Each move and its undo logic are encapsulated in the `MoveCommand` class.
- **Reusability**: Commands can be reused and extended for other types of moves (e.g., castling, pawn promotion).
- **Extensibility**: New commands (e.g., special moves) can be easily added without modifying existing code.
- **Flexibility**: Using stacks allows easy management of undo/redo operations with minimal overhead.

### General UML Diagram for Undo/Redo as a Command Pattern

The UML diagram for this approach would include:
- A `Command` interface with `execute()` and `undo()` methods.
- A `MoveCommand` class implementing `Command`.
- A `Board` class representing the game state.
- A `Game` class managing the history stacks (`undoStack` and `redoStack`) and invoking commands.

If you'd like, I can create a UML diagram to visualize this design. Would you like me to do that?
