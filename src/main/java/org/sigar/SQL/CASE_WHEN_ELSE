In SQL, `CASE` expressions allow you to implement conditional logic in queries, similar to `if-else` statements in programming languages. It allows you to return different values based on different conditions. The `CASE` expression is commonly used in `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `WHERE` clauses.

The structure of the `CASE` expression can include:
- **WHEN**: Specifies a condition to evaluate.
- **THEN**: The value to return if the condition is true.
- **ELSE** (or **OTHER** in some implementations): The value to return if none of the conditions are true (optional).
- **END**: Marks the end of the `CASE` expression.

### Syntax

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE resultN -- (optional)
END
```

### Example 1: Using `CASE` in a `SELECT` Statement

Here’s an example where you want to label the salary ranges for employees based on their `salary` field in the `employees` table:

```sql
SELECT employee_name,
       salary,
       CASE
           WHEN salary > 100000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS salary_range
FROM employees;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - If `salary` is greater than 100,000, the label will be 'High'.
  - If `salary` is between 50,000 and 100,000, it will be 'Medium'.
  - If `salary` does not meet any of these conditions, it will be 'Low'.

### Example 2: Using `CASE` with Multiple Conditions

In this example, we categorize employees based on their `department` and `salary`. We want to return a message based on the combination of both conditions:

```sql
SELECT employee_name,
       department,
       salary,
       CASE
           WHEN department = 'Sales' AND salary > 80000 THEN 'Top Salesperson'
           WHEN department = 'Engineering' AND salary > 120000 THEN 'Senior Engineer'
           ELSE 'Standard Employee'
       END AS employee_status
FROM employees;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - If the employee works in 'Sales' and has a salary greater than 80,000, they will be labeled 'Top Salesperson'.
  - If the employee works in 'Engineering' and has a salary greater than 120,000, they will be labeled 'Senior Engineer'.
  - If neither condition is met, the employee will be labeled 'Standard Employee'.

### Example 3: Using `CASE` in an `UPDATE` Statement

You can also use the `CASE` statement in an `UPDATE` query. Suppose you want to update the status of orders based on the number of items ordered:

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET order_status = CASE
                     WHEN items_ordered > 10 THEN 'Bulk Order'
                     WHEN items_ordered BETWEEN 5 AND 10 THEN 'Regular Order'
                     ELSE 'Small Order'
                   END
WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01';
```

- **Explanation**:
  - Orders with more than 10 items will be marked as 'Bulk Order'.
  - Orders with 5-10 items will be marked as 'Regular Order'.
  - Orders with fewer than 5 items will be marked as 'Small Order'.
  - The condition in the `WHERE` clause restricts the updates to orders placed after January 1, 2024.

### Example 4: Using `CASE` in a `WHERE` Clause

You can use `CASE` to make decisions within the `WHERE` clause. For example, applying a different condition based on the employee's department:

```sql
SELECT employee_name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE CASE
          WHEN department = 'HR' THEN salary > 50000
          WHEN department = 'IT' THEN salary > 70000
          ELSE salary > 40000
      END;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - If the department is 'HR', the condition checks if the salary is greater than 50,000.
  - If the department is 'IT', the condition checks if the salary is greater than 70,000.
  - For all other departments, it checks if the salary is greater than 40,000.

### Example 5: Using `CASE` with Aggregation Functions

You can use `CASE` with aggregate functions such as `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, or `AVG()` to compute conditional aggregates. For example, counting the number of employees in different salary ranges:

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(CASE WHEN salary > 100000 THEN 1 END) AS high_salary_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 1 END) AS medium_salary_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 1 END) AS low_salary_count
FROM employees;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `CASE` expression inside `COUNT()` counts employees in different salary ranges.
  - It counts employees with a high salary (greater than 100,000), medium salary (50,000 to 100,000), and low salary (less than 50,000).

### Example 6: Using `CASE` with Date Functions

Here’s how you can use `CASE` with dates. Suppose you have a table called `orders` with a column `order_date`, and you want to classify the orders based on whether they were placed in the current year or in the past:

```sql
SELECT order_id,
       order_date,
       CASE
           WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) THEN 'Current Year'
           ELSE 'Previous Year'
       END AS order_timeframe
FROM orders;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - If the `order_date` is in the current year, it returns 'Current Year'.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'Previous Year'.

### Key Points

- **`CASE` works as a conditional expression** similar to `if-else` in programming languages.
- **`CASE` expressions can be used in `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `WHERE`, and other SQL statements**.
- **The `ELSE` clause is optional**. If `ELSE` is omitted, and no condition is met, the `CASE` expression will return `NULL`.
