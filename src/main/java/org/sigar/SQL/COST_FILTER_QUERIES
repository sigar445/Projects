If the query returns **6,000 matching rows** instead of a single row, the cost of the index scan will increase because more data pages need to be accessed and more rows need to be processed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### **Adjustments for 6,000 Matching Rows**
When 6,000 rows are returned by the query, the database engine will need to:
- Access the index to find the 6,000 matching rows.
- Retrieve the corresponding data pages where these rows are stored.
- Process and return the data for these rows.

### **1. Sequential Scan (Full Table Scan)**
The full table scan doesn't change significantly whether 1 row or 6,000 rows are returned, as it still has to scan the entire table. The CPU cost for processing rows will increase because more rows need to be checked.

#### **Sequential Scan Summary**:
- **Pages scanned**: All 74,074 pages (since it's still a full scan).
- **CPU cost**: The CPU now has to process 6,000 matching rows out of the 6,000,000 rows, which is slightly higher but still proportional to the overall scan.

#### **CPU cost calculation**:
If checking each row takes **0.01ms**, and we check all 6,000,000 rows:
\[
6,000,000 \text{ rows} \times 0.01 \text{ ms/row} = 60,000 \text{ ms} = 60 \text{ seconds}
\]
No significant change occurs in CPU cost since all rows are processed anyway.

#### **Total sequential scan cost**:
- **I/O**: 12.35 minutes (same as before).
- **CPU**: 1 minute (processing all rows).
- **Total**: **13.35 minutes**, as most of the cost is due to reading the full table.

### **2. Index Scan (Binary Search) with 6,000 Matching Rows**
When 6,000 rows match, the index scan must access more data pages since these rows are likely spread across multiple pages. Letâ€™s estimate the impact:

#### **Data Page Estimation**:
- Each page holds 81 rows (as calculated before).
- To retrieve 6,000 rows, the database will need to access:
\[
\frac{6,000 \text{ rows}}{81 \text{ rows/page}} \approx 74 \text{ data pages}
\]
So, **74 data pages** will be read from disk.

#### **Index Pages Scanned**:
- The index still requires reading 4 pages (one per level of the B-tree), as the index depth does not change.

#### **Total Pages Scanned**:
- **Index pages**: 4 pages (as before).
- **Data pages**: 74 pages (to retrieve 6,000 rows).

Total pages scanned:
\[
4 \text{ (index pages)} + 74 \text{ (data pages)} = 78 \text{ pages}
\]

#### **I/O cost**:
If reading a page from disk still takes 10ms, the total I/O time is:
\[
78 \text{ pages} \times 10 \text{ ms/page} = 780 \text{ ms}
\]

#### **CPU cost**:
The CPU now has to process 6,000 rows, and if each row takes 0.01ms:
\[
6,000 \text{ rows} \times 0.01 \text{ ms/row} = 60 \text{ ms}
\]

#### **Total Index Scan Cost**:
- **I/O**: 780ms (reading 78 pages).
- **CPU**: 60ms (processing 6,000 rows).
- **Total**: **780ms + 60ms = 840ms** (0.84 seconds).

### **Comparison:**
| **Scan Type**     | **Pages Scanned** | **I/O Time (ms)** | **CPU Time (ms)** | **Total Time**   |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Sequential Scan**| 74,074 pages      | 740,740 ms        | 60,000 ms         | **800.74 seconds (13.35 minutes)** |
| **Index Scan**     | 78 pages          | 780 ms            | 60 ms             | **840 milliseconds (0.84 seconds)** |

### **Conclusion**
- **Sequential Scan**: No significant change, still requires scanning the entire table. Total time is over 13 minutes.
- **Index Scan**: The cost increases with the number of matching rows, but even with 6,000 matches, the index scan is **far more efficient**, taking less than **1 second** to complete (compared to 13+ minutes for a full table scan).

This illustrates that even with a moderate number of matching rows (6,000), an index scan is vastly more efficient than a sequential scan for large tables.
