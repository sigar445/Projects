SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained SQL database engine that supports most of the standard SQL commands. Below are some commonly used commands for SQLite, including how to describe a table and perform various database operations.

### 1. Creating a Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE salary_range_by_job_classification (
    job_classification TEXT NOT NULL,
    min_salary REAL,
    max_salary REAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. Inserting Data

```sql
INSERT INTO salary_range_by_job_classification (job_classification, min_salary, max_salary)
VALUES ('Software Engineer', 60000, 120000),
       ('Data Scientist', 70000, 130000),
       ('Project Manager', 50000, 110000);
```

### 3. Selecting Data

```sql
SELECT * FROM salary_range_by_job_classification;
```

### 4. Describing a Table

SQLite does not have a built-in `DESC` command like some other SQL databases, but you can use the following command to get the schema of a table:

```sql
PRAGMA table_info(salary_range_by_job_classification);
```

This command will return information about the columns in the specified table, including the column names, data types, and whether they can be NULL.

### 5. Updating Data

```sql
UPDATE salary_range_by_job_classification
SET min_salary = 65000
WHERE job_classification = 'Software Engineer';
```

### 6. Deleting Data

```sql
DELETE FROM salary_range_by_job_classification
WHERE job_classification = 'Project Manager';
```

### 7. Grouping and Aggregating Data

You can use `GROUP BY` to group results and aggregate them. Hereâ€™s an example that calculates the average salary for each job classification:

```sql
SELECT job_classification, AVG(min_salary) AS average_min_salary, AVG(max_salary) AS average_max_salary
FROM salary_range_by_job_classification
GROUP BY job_classification;
```

### 8. Creating an Index

Creating an index can help improve the performance of queries:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_job_classification ON salary_range_by_job_classification (job_classification);
```

### 9. Dropping a Table

To drop a table from the database:

```sql
DROP TABLE salary_range_by_job_classification;
```

### 10. Viewing All Tables

To see a list of all tables in the current SQLite database:

```sql
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';
```

### Summary

These commands cover a range of operations you might perform in SQLite, from table creation to data manipulation and schema examination. If you have any specific operations or queries in mind, feel free to ask!
