In SQL, **Views** are virtual tables that allow you to present a specific dataset derived from one or more tables. Views are useful for abstracting complex queries, improving security, and simplifying data access. They don’t store data themselves but provide a way to query the underlying tables. Let’s explore all the variations of views, how they work internally, and their practical use cases.

### What is a View?

A **view** is essentially a stored query that behaves like a table. You can use it in SQL queries just like a regular table, but it does not store the data itself; instead, it pulls data from the underlying tables whenever accessed.

### Basic Syntax for Creating a View

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Example: Basic View

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_salary AS
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

This view, `employee_salary`, will return the `employee_name` and `salary` columns from the `employees` table, but only for employees with a salary greater than 50,000.

### Types of Views

1. **Simple Views**
2. **Complex Views**
3. **Updatable Views**
4. **Materialized Views** (in some databases)

### 1. **Simple Views**

A **simple view** is created from a single table and does not contain aggregate functions or joins. It typically includes only a subset of the table's columns and rows.

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 100000;
```

This view filters data from the `employees` table and shows only employees with a high salary. It is a simple view since it involves a single table with no complex operations.

### 2. **Complex Views**

A **complex view** involves multiple tables, joins, aggregate functions, or other operations like grouping or unions. These views abstract complex data logic.

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_department AS
SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name, e.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > 50000;
```

This complex view joins two tables (`employees` and `departments`) and filters data based on a salary condition.

### 3. **Updatable Views**

In SQL, some views are **updatable**, meaning you can perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations directly on the view, and those operations will affect the underlying tables. However, certain conditions must be met for a view to be updatable:
- The view must reference only one base table.
- The view must include all the primary key columns from the underlying table.
- The view must not include aggregate functions, `GROUP BY`, or `DISTINCT`.

#### Example of an Updatable View:

```sql
CREATE VIEW employees_contact_info AS
SELECT employee_id, employee_name, email
FROM employees;
```

If this view is updatable, you could run an `UPDATE` query like this:

```sql
UPDATE employees_contact_info
SET email = 'newemail@example.com'
WHERE employee_id = 101;
```

The above query would update the `email` column in the `employees` table, not in the view itself, because the view does not store data.

### 4. **Materialized Views** (Only in Some Databases)

A **materialized view** is a view that physically stores the result of the query at the time it is created. It is used when performance is crucial, and refreshing the data periodically is acceptable. Unlike normal views, materialized views store the query result and do not fetch data from the underlying tables every time the view is accessed.

#### Example in PostgreSQL:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_aggregates AS
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

You can **refresh** a materialized view manually or automatically:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_aggregates;
```

### Internals of How Views Work

Internally, when you query a **view**, the database does the following:
1. **Rewrites the View Query**: The database rewrites the query against the view to access the underlying base tables.
2. **Optimization**: The rewritten query undergoes query optimization like any other SQL query. Indexes on the base tables will be used if applicable.
3. **Execution**: The database fetches the required data from the base tables, applies any filtering or aggregation specified in the view, and returns the result set.

Since views are essentially stored queries, they don’t store any data. However, when you use a **materialized view**, the data is stored physically in the database, which speeds up retrieval but requires manual or automatic refreshing to stay up-to-date with changes in the underlying tables.

### Benefits of Using Views

- **Data Abstraction**: Simplifies complex queries by abstracting them into views.
- **Security**: You can provide access to certain data in a table without exposing the entire table. For example, a view can hide sensitive columns like salary.
- **Reusability**: Views allow you to reuse complex SQL logic in multiple queries without rewriting it.
- **Logical Independence**: If the structure of underlying tables changes, you can adjust the view without modifying the queries that depend on it.

### Modifying a View

To modify an existing view, use the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` statement:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_salary AS
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000;
```

This statement will update the definition of the view without changing its name.

### Dropping a View

To remove a view, use the `DROP VIEW` statement:

```sql
DROP VIEW employee_salary;
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Normal Views**: Since normal views do not store data, they can slow down query performance if the underlying query is complex, especially with large tables or joins.
- **Materialized Views**: Materialized views improve query performance as they store the result of the query. However, the data in materialized views can become stale and may need to be refreshed periodically.

### Examples of Advanced Uses

#### Example: View with Aggregation

```sql
CREATE VIEW department_salary AS
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

This view computes average and total salaries for each department.

#### Example: View with `CASE` Expression

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_status AS
SELECT employee_name,
       CASE
           WHEN salary > 100000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS salary_level
FROM employees;
```

This view classifies employees based on their salary.

### Summary

- **Simple View**: Derived from a single table without any complex operations.
- **Complex View**: Involves multiple tables, joins, and complex operations like grouping.
- **Updatable View**: Some views can be updated, depending on the complexity and structure.
- **Materialized View**: Stores the result of a query physically for performance optimization (used in databases like PostgreSQL and Oracle).
The error you are encountering is due to the fact that SQL doesn't allow renaming view columns when using `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`. The column names must remain the same as they were in the original view, even if the underlying query changes.

Since your original view had a column named `employee_name`, you cannot change it to `name` directly using the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` syntax. To achieve the desired result, you need to **drop** the view first and then **recreate** it with the correct column names.

Here’s how you can handle it:

### Step 1: Drop the Existing View

First, drop the view with the previous column name:

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS employee_salary;
```

### Step 2: Recreate the View with the New Column Name

Now, recreate the view with the correct column names:

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_salary AS
SELECT name AS name, salary AS employee_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000;
```

### Explanation:
- The `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS` ensures that the old view is removed before creating a new one with the desired column name.
- In the new view definition, you're correctly aliasing the `name` column to `name` and `salary` to `employee_salary`.

This will create the view with the updated column names as expected.
