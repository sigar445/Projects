Designing software involves two key perspectives: **structure** (how the code is organized) and **behavior** (how it operates and responds to inputs). Effective code design requires a balance between these aspects, as structural choices can significantly impact behavioral flexibility and vice versa. Let’s explore both concepts, how to start with each, and examples to illustrate them.

### Structural Changes in Code Design

**1. Understanding Structure:**
   Structure focuses on the static organization of your code—its components, modules, classes, and their relationships. Good structural design aligns with principles like modularity, cohesion, encapsulation, and separation of concerns.

**2. Steps to Approach Structural Design:**
   - **Define Responsibilities and Boundaries:** Identify distinct components and assign specific responsibilities, avoiding overlap. For example, in a microservice architecture, each service should handle a particular business capability.
   - **Apply Design Patterns:** Patterns like Factory, Singleton, or Repository can enforce structure, making the code modular, testable, and easier to maintain.
   - **Design for Flexibility and Reuse:** Aim to make components modular and reusable across the application by defining clear interfaces, keeping dependencies minimal, and using dependency injection.
   - **Organize into Layers:** Use layering (e.g., Presentation, Service, Repository) to separate concerns, improving maintainability and testing. This approach is often used in Spring Boot applications.

**3. Structural Design Example:**
   Suppose you are designing a library system with modules like `Book`, `Patron`, and `Loan`.

   - **Before Structural Change:**
     ```java
     class LibraryService {
         public void checkoutBook(Book book, Patron patron) { ... }
         public void returnBook(Book book, Patron patron) { ... }
         public void addBook(Book book) { ... }
         public void registerPatron(Patron patron) { ... }
         // many other methods...
     }
     ```
     Here, the `LibraryService` class has too many responsibilities, mixing book operations with patron operations and handling various tasks without clear separation.

   - **After Structural Change:**
     ```java
     class BookService {
         public void addBook(Book book) { ... }
         public void updateBookDetails(Book book) { ... }
     }

     class PatronService {
         public void registerPatron(Patron patron) { ... }
     }

     class LoanService {
         public void checkoutBook(Book book, Patron patron) { ... }
         public void returnBook(Book book, Patron patron) { ... }
     }
     ```
     By breaking down responsibilities into separate services (`BookService`, `PatronService`, and `LoanService`), you increase modularity and separation of concerns. Each service now has a clear, cohesive role, making it easier to extend and maintain.

### Behavioral Changes in Code Design

**1. Understanding Behavior:**
   Behavior defines how the system reacts to inputs, performs computations, or interacts with external systems. A behavioral change might involve the flow of logic within a function, the way data is processed, or how dependencies interact during runtime.

**2. Steps to Approach Behavioral Design:**
   - **Start with Use Cases:** Define the behaviors required by understanding user stories or business requirements. Identify the inputs, expected outcomes, and interactions with other systems.
   - **Design for Flexibility:** Avoid rigid if-else structures or hard-coded values that make behavior difficult to adjust. Instead, use strategy patterns, state machines, or event-driven designs to make behavior adaptable.
   - **Encapsulate Business Logic in Functions or Classes:** Keep logic close to the data it operates on, ensuring behaviors are encapsulated within relevant entities or service classes.
   - **Use Domain Events and Observers:** In complex systems, behavioral changes often involve multiple subsystems. Event-driven approaches, like publishing domain events, help keep the code clean and decoupled.

**3. Behavioral Design Example:**
   Continuing with the library system, let’s design behavior for checking out a book with validation rules (e.g., "A patron can have only 5 books checked out at a time").

   - **Before Behavioral Change:**
     ```java
     public void checkoutBook(Book book, Patron patron) {
         if (patron.getCheckedOutBooks().size() < 5) {
             patron.addBook(book);
             System.out.println("Book checked out.");
         } else {
             System.out.println("Checkout limit reached.");
         }
     }
     ```
     This code lacks flexibility. If we later add more validation rules (e.g., overdue fines), this function becomes cluttered with conditional logic.

   - **After Behavioral Change:**
     Using the **Strategy Pattern** to encapsulate checkout rules.
     ```java
     interface CheckoutRule {
         boolean canCheckout(Patron patron);
     }

     class MaxBooksRule implements CheckoutRule {
         @Override
         public boolean canCheckout(Patron patron) {
             return patron.getCheckedOutBooks().size() < 5;
         }
     }

     class NoOverdueFinesRule implements CheckoutRule {
         @Override
         public boolean canCheckout(Patron patron) {
             return !patron.hasOverdueFines();
         }
     }

     class LoanService {
         private List<CheckoutRule> rules = List.of(new MaxBooksRule(), new NoOverdueFinesRule());

         public void checkoutBook(Book book, Patron patron) {
             for (CheckoutRule rule : rules) {
                 if (!rule.canCheckout(patron)) {
                     System.out.println("Checkout not allowed due to rule: " + rule.getClass().getSimpleName());
                     return;
                 }
             }
             patron.addBook(book);
             System.out.println("Book checked out.");
         }
     }
     ```
     With this refactored design, you can easily add new rules without changing the existing logic in `LoanService`. Each rule has a single responsibility and can be reused or modified independently.

### Combining Structure and Behavior

1. **Define Use Cases and Boundaries Together:** Start by understanding the primary use cases and map out structural boundaries around them. For instance, in a library system, defining which behaviors (`checkout`, `return`, `reserve`) belong within each module helps clarify structural boundaries.
2. **Apply Design Patterns to Support Both Aspects:** Structural patterns (like **Repository** or **Factory**) define module relationships, while behavioral patterns (like **Strategy** or **Observer**) help encapsulate behavior within structures.
3. **Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** In DDD, both structure and behavior align around domains (e.g., `Library`, `Patron`, `Book`), where each domain encapsulates its structure (entities, repositories) and behavior (domain logic, events). This approach encourages cohesive boundaries and behavior tied to each domain concept.

### Example of Combining Structure and Behavior

Consider a **Loan** aggregate that handles both structural and behavioral needs.

```java
@Entity
public class Loan extends AbstractAggregateRoot<Loan> {
    @Id
    private UUID id;

    @ManyToOne
    private Book book;

    @ManyToOne
    private Patron patron;

    private LocalDate dateOfLoan;
    private LoanStatus status;

    // Structural methods (setters, getters, associations)

    public Loan checkout(LocalDate checkoutDate) {
        this.dateOfLoan = checkoutDate;
        this.status = LoanStatus.ACTIVE;
        registerEvent(new LoanCheckedOutEvent(this.id));
        return this;
    }

    public Loan returnLoan(LocalDate returnDate) {
        this.status = LoanStatus.RETURNED;
        registerEvent(new LoanReturnedEvent(this.id));
        return this;
    }

    public boolean isEligibleForCheckout(Patron patron) {
        // Behavior validation logic
        return patron.isEligible();
    }
}
```

Here:
- **Structure** is maintained with fields, associations, and encapsulated behavior (`checkout` and `returnLoan`) for clarity.
- **Behavior** is flexible with business rules like `isEligibleForCheckout` and domain events registered for specific behaviors (checkout, return).

This approach makes the code flexible, modular, and easy to maintain, with each class clearly organized around both structural roles and behavioral responsibilities.
